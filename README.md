# Create-Online-Notes

Note Taking Website App using pure JavaScript. We all have a notes app on our mobiles  or laptop. Note-taking websites are the online equivalent of notebooks, and because they  are digital, they can do more for you than paper ever could. 
In this Project I only used only Vanilla JavaScript. In this website you can easily create note by giving title and by adding note. Without giving title and adding note if you try to create note it will give error message. Once you create note it will be saved until you delete that note. As I used localStorage in this website if you close the the tab or browser, your notes will be still saved. There is also a search feature, with the help of search feature you can search you notes just by writing any word which is present in that note.
